Welcome to Project Taipingu. Taipingu, which means "Typing" in Japanese, is a anime-themed typing website that gives a wonderful experience for the users when they practice their typing skills. I'd like to thank Replit for helping me complete my project which would have been really difficult with solo working. With that being said, I don't claim all the codes to be written by me, but rather a good help of AI involved. The website has options for the user, to choose a book they wish to type the texts from and the level of difficulty based on how challenging they want their practice session to be. With a live interactive virtual keyboard that shows what keys you've hit on your keyboard, it makes it much easier for the user to look at the screen rather than on their keyboard, which is a crucial thing to know when learning to type. Thank you, and happy Taipingu!
